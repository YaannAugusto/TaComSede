<h2>Website look</h2>

<h4>1.1 Login Page</h4>

<p>For a person who wants to use the website, they need to authenticate, that is, validate their information so that they can interact with the program. To do this, the user will have to create a type of form, passing some information to the system. He needs to fill in his email, password, CPF, and personal telephone number. All fields are mandatory so that each user can be differentiated in several ways. To achieve authentication, Identity was used, an API that helps manage personnel entry.</p>

<h4>1.2 Main page</h4>

<p>After logging in, authentication is done and takes you to the main menu. On the page in question, the user has access to the “Main”, “Profile”, “Drinks”, “Brands”, “Cart” and “Catalogs” tabs. All pages on the website have the same layout, so that the customer can navigate more easily.</p>

<h4>1.3 Categories page</h4>

<p>On the Categories screen, the customer will have a main message explaining the existing page. Just below, there is a menu of all the categories registered by the site. At the beginning, it has four sample categories and an arrow, which will show you more categories it has. When clicking on one of the categories, the user will be sent to a page with filtered drinks based on the chosen category.</p>

<h4>1.4 Brand page</h4>

<p>In brand, the user will have a screen showing all registered trademarks. Each drink has a brand in which it was inserted, for example, the Brahma brand double malt beer. When you click on one of the brand logos, a new screen will open with all the drinks from that brand, creating a filter.</p>
